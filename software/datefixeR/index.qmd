[datefixR](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/datefixR/index.html) standardizes dates in different formats or with missing data: for example dates which have been provided from free text web forms.

More info in the [website](https://docs.ropensci.org/datefixR/) of the project. 

There are also a [shinyapp](https://nathansam.shinyapps.io/datefixr/) to quickly "play" with the `datefixeR` package. 

My contribution to this package was as **collaborator** (ctb) and **translator** (trl) to allow the package work with dates in Spanish.
