The [likelihoodTools](https://ajpelu.github.io/likelihoodTools/) R package is built to make working with Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) outputs from [likelihood](https://cran.r-project.org/package=likelihood) package more accessible. Extending the functionality of the likelihood package, it offers a suite of functions to organize, visualize, and summarize parameter estimates. By streamlining these tasks, likelihoodTools helps researchers move more easily from raw estimation results to meaningful statistical insights.

Please see the [website](https://ajpelu.github.io/likelihoodTools/) with starting tutorials or download it from [CRAN-R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/likelihoodTools/index.html) ([10.32614/CRAN.package.likelihoodTools](https://doi.org/10.32614/CRAN.package.likelihoodTools))
